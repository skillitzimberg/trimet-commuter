# Trimet Commuter

![](screenshots/HomeScreen.png)

TriMet Commuter is a light TriMet transit tool. Enter your daily morning and evening stops. TriMet Commuter will display vehicles arriving at these stops within 30 minutes, their arrival times, status (late, on time, etc.). Between midnight and noon your morning stop data will display; between noon and midnight you'll see your evening stop.

You can use project [here](https://trimet-commuter.firebaseapp.com).

## Resources

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0.

See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for details about tools you may need to install and use to work on and use this project on your Mac.  

Here are some links in case you need information about setup for other operating systems:  
[Angular](https://angular.io/)  
[Angularfire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)  
[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)  
[Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/latest/index.html)  
[Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/)  
[Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/)  
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## Setup and Installation
After making sure that you have everything you need from [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) . . .

. . . fork the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/philrmass/trimet-commuter).  

Clone your forked repository to your computer.  

Use your preferred command line/terminal to navigate into the directory:
```
cd trimet-commuter/
```

Open the project in a text editor like Atom or VS Code.

#### Setup for Firebase database usage
Go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/).
Set up an account for yourself. If you already have a Google or Gmail account, you already have access - just sign in.  

Once you're logged in, go to the [console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Use the option to add a new project. Provide a name for your new project, and select your Country/region from the drop-down menu. Click "Create Project."

You'll then be taken to an "Overview" area. Where you'll be offered three options to add Firebase for:  

- iOS app (ios logo)
- Android app (android logo)
- web app (</>)

Select Add Firebase to your web app. Firebase should respond with a pop-up modal window. Keep the information in this modal handy.  

Create a new file called api-keys.ts in the src/app directory. This file has been added to the .gitingore, so your credentials will not be pushed to Github.  

Copy your Firebase credentials into api-keys.ts (the x's represent your specific information just for this example. Replace them with your actual credentials):
```
export const masterFirebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "xxxx",
    authDomain: "xxxx.firebaseapp.com",
    databaseURL: "https://xxxx.firebaseio.com",
    storageBucket: "xxxx.appspot.com",
    messagingSenderId: "xxxx"
  };
```

**NOTE: The exported constant in the above code must be named masterFirebaseConfig. If you decide to rename it here you will need to find masterFirebaseConfig everywhere in the project and replace it with your constant's name.**

#### Set up log in authorization
From the console go to the authorization page. You'll see the options: Users, Sign-in method, Templates, Usage. Click on Sign-in method. Choose Email/Password. Enable the option that says, "Allow users to sign up using their email address and password."

#### Setup for using the TriMet API
Go to [Trimet Developer Services](https://developer.trimet.org/appid/registration/) to register your app. Your application id will be emailed to you along with a link to confirm your registration.  

This application uses [Arrivals Web Service V2](https://developer.trimet.org/ws_docs/arrivals2_ws.shtml) and the HTTP GET parameters style:
```
https://developer.trimet.org/ws/V1/arrivals?locIDs=6849,6850&appID=0000000000000000000000000
```

In the api-keys.ts file mentioned above save your trimet app id as:

```
 export const trimetApiKey = 'yourAPIkey';
```
Replace 'yourAPIkey' in the code above with the app id that was emailed to you.

As with the Firebase api key above, you must name the TriMet app id "trimetApiKey" or else you'll have to rename it elsewhere in the code.

#### Run the application
In the project root directory run the command:
```
npm install
```

Run the command:
```
ng serve --open
```
Your default browser should open a new window or tab with the website/app ready to use at [localhost:4200](localhost:4200).  

## Future Features
- The Quick Stop feature to get arrivals for a stop that may not be a part of your normal commute/routine. Quick Stop will save the last 5 searches made.

## Known Bugs
* [AUTH SERVICE]
  * issue- returns USER object when wrong credentials entered.
  * expected behavior- does not return USER object
* [USER DATA]
  * request- missing 'formal stop' name
* [QUICK STOP - RECENTS]
  * should not store a searched stop if that stop is already in recents
